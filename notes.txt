How Many Tiles and Dots Are In A Dominoes Set?

Standard 6x6 Domino Set

The number of tiles in a dominoes set is calculated by the following formula (where 
n is the highest number on a domino, e.g. "6" for a double-six set):

number of tiles = ((n^2 + (3 * n) + 2) / 2)

The number of dots (pips) in a dominoes set is calculated by the following formula 
(again, n is the highest number on a domino):

number of dots = ((n^3) / 2) + ((3 * n^2) / 2) + n

This also works out to a much easier formula:

number of dots = number of tiles * n
Here are the totals for all common domino sets, in a table:

Domino Set	            Number of Tiles	    Number of Dots
Double Six (6-6)	    28	                168
Double Nine (9-9)	    55	                495
Double Twelve (12-12)	91	                1092
Double Fifteen (15-15)	136	                2040
Double Eighteen (18-18)	190	                3420
